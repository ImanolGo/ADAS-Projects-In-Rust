# 🚦 Coding Activity 2 – Development of Traffic Sign Recognition System for ADAS 🚸

## 📝 Description

This coding activity focuses on the development of a Traffic Sign Recognition system, an important ADAS functionality. It aims to mitigate the risk of drivers missing crucial traffic signs during their journey. The system uses AI algorithms in conjunction with the front camera of the vehicle to detect and display traffic signs on the instrument cluster.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Develop the Traffic Sign Recognition system in Rust.
- Use computer vision and appropriate machine learning or deep learning algorithms.
- Download a publicly available dataset containing traffic sign images.
- Develop and train a deep learning CNN model, setting aside some data for validation and testing.
- After achieving high accuracy through training and validation, test the model on the test dataset and save it for later use.
