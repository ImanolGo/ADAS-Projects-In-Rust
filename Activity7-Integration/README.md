# 🧩 Coding Activity 7 – Let's Put All Together 🧩

## 📝 Description

This is the culmination of all the previous coding activities. By this point, we have individually developed:
- Lane Detection
- Traffic Sign Recognition
- Speed Limit Recognition
- Street Lamp Detection and Recognition
- Instrument Cluster GUI

Now, the objective is to integrate all these features into one cohesive system.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Use Rust for development. Consider using Object-Oriented Programming for better integration.
- Take various video feeds as input to your system.
- Adapt all the previously implemented algorithms to work in conjunction. 
- The aim is to detect lanes, traffic signs, speed limits, and street lamps, and display them on the GUI in real-time as they are detected in the video feed.
- Test the complete system with multiple video feeds.
