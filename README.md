# ðŸš— ADAS Projects In Rust ðŸ¦€

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository dedicated to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)! I've recently completed an [ADAS course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-driver-assistance-systems/), and I'm excited to share my journey implementing these critical systems using Rust. Why Rust? It offers both performance and safety, essential attributes when we're talking about systems that can save lives on the road.

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

The world is shifting towards automation and intelligent systems, and the automotive industry is no exception. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have a profound impact on safety and driving experience. Having specialized in embedded systems and AI in the ADAS division, I see the immense potential and challenges in this field. I chose Rust to push the boundaries of what's possible in terms of performance, safety, and code quality.
