# 📸 Coding Activity 4 – Object Detection using YOLOv3 🚗🚶‍♂️

## 📝 Description

Object detection is crucial in ADAS systems for identifying objects that could lead to hazardous situations. Cameras are especially proficient at this task and are often used in conjunction with other sensors like Radar for data fusion. This activity aims to implement one of the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once), known for its efficiency.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Develop the Object Detection system in Rust.
- Download YOLOv3 model parameters and implement the algorithm to detect objects in road images.
- Test the algorithm on a variety of road images.
- Optionally, filter out unimportant object classes to focus on crucial road elements like cars, buses, pedestrians, bicycles, street lights, and traffic signs.
- Perform additional tests with these filters.
