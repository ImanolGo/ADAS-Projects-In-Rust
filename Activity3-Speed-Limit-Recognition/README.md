# 🚗 Coding Activity 3 – Development of Speed Limit Recognition System for ADAS 🛑

## 📝 Description

Speed Limit Recognition is a specialized subset of Traffic Sign Recognition systems. Understanding the speed limits of different road sections is essential for road safety and to avoid penalties. This system uses AI algorithms in tandem with the front camera of the vehicle to identify speed limit signs and display them on the instrument panel.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Develop the Speed Limit Recognition system in Rust.
- Use computer vision techniques, along with machine learning or deep learning algorithms.
- Obtain a publicly available dataset containing speed limit sign images.
- Train a deep learning CNN model using the dataset, reserving some data for validation and testing.
- Upon successful validation with high accuracy, test the model on a test dataset and save it for future use.
- Further validate the system with different speed limit images or video feeds.
