# 🛣️ Coding Activity 1 – Development of Lane Detection system for ADAS application

## 📝 Description

This activity focuses on the development of a Lane Detection system using Rust. The system utilizes the front camera feed of an ego vehicle to detect lanes on the road. Understanding the lanes is a critical component in various ADAS features like Lane Departure Warning, Lane Change Assist, and Lane Keep Assist among others.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Develop the system in Rust.
- Utilize computer vision techniques and any required machine learning or deep learning algorithms.
- Use a video from public datasets like KITTI, nuscenes, or others that have clear lane markings from a front camera perspective.
- Implement and validate the lane detection system.
- Continuously detect lanes in real-time on the video.
